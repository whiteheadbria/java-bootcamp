Module One: 

[Chatbot:](https://github.com/whiteheadbria/java-bootcamp/blob/ffaa7baa58422bd83714f2484ec2feaf69f16290/Module%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Java/2.%20Variables/Challenge%202/Chatbot.java) A basic chatbot application that talks to the user. Carries a very simple conversation 

[Trivia Quiz:](https://github.com/whiteheadbria/java-bootcamp/blob/main/Module%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Java/3.%20Booleans%20and%20Conditionals/Challenge%203/Quiz.java) A basic trivia application that gives the user six questions, based on motorsports, and scores the answers out of 30. 

[Dice Jack:](https://github.com/whiteheadbria/java-bootcamp/blob/main/Module%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Java/4.%20Functions/Section%204/DiceJack.java) Three dice are automatically rolled then the user inputs three numbers between 1 - 6. The user wins if the sum of the rolled dice is less than their inputted numbers AND the difference between the two sums is less than three. 

[Rock, Paper, Scissors:](https://github.com/whiteheadbria/java-bootcamp/blob/main/Module%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Java/4.%20Functions/Challenge%204/RockPaperScissors.java) A basic program of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The computer gets a random pick between the numbers 0-2 using the Math.random() function. Switch cases determine if it's rock, paper, or scissors. Using 'if,' 'else-if,' and 'else' statements, the results are shown on the screen. 

[Pockerito:](https://github.com/whiteheadbria/java-bootcamp/tree/main/Module%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Java/5.%20Loops/Pokerito) It's almost like Poker. The dealer gives the user and computer one random card to begin with. Using a 'for' loop, the user presses enter 5 times for the terminal to output a random drawn card each time. Between the user and the computer, whoever's first card matches the most of the five cards drawn wins. 

[Blackjack:](https://github.com/whiteheadbria/java-bootcamp/tree/main/Module%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Java/5.%20Loops/Challenge) Blackjack is the most popular table game at casinos; this is a simple version of Blackjack built in Java. In Blackjack, the player plays against the dealer. The dealer (computer) gives the player two cards faceup. The dealer also starts with two cards. But, only one of the dealer's cards is faceup. The other is facedown. First, it's the player's turn. The player can decide to hit or stay. 
If the player decides to hit, and their hand value exceeds 21, they go bust (lose). Once the player decides to stay, the dealer reveals the hidden card. Then, the dealer must hit until their cards total up to 17. At 17 points or higher, the dealer must stay.
